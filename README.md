## This Is Literally Just What I Sent In The Chat

Okay, I've got a couple of songs stuck in my head and I realized that they blend into each other
I think it could be fun to try to come up with a mashup generator of sorts 
Just visualized a UI that's a 3d graph of similarity and I've been meaning to play around with three.js
Automated DJ cuts, more or less
Like, a track in the center and then others radiating out based on where you want to take the mix
